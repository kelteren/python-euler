'''
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3+ 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example,
(three hundred and forty-two) contains letters and (one hundred and fifteen) contains letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.
